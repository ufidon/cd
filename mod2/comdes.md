Digital system design procedure

f("笶ｷ formulation")

v("笶ｺ verification")

```
- 笶ｶ specify functions and requirements
- 笶ｷ formulate specification in Boolean equation or truth table
- 笶ｸ optimize formulation
- 笶ｹ map optimization to implementation technology
- 笶ｺ verify that the implementation fullfil the specification


Top-down design
---
- also called hierarchical design
- a divide-and-conquer method
- break the digital system into implementable or reusable building blocks
- combine the building blocks into the final digital system


沚 Design of a 4-bit equality Comparator
---
- specification:
  - output 1 if A[3:0]==B[3:0] else 0
- formulation:
  - compare bit-by-bit respectively
  - aggregate the 4 outputs
  - $F = (A[3]筧。[3])(A[2]筧。[2])(A[1]筧。[1])(A[0]筧。[0])$
- optimization:
  - algebraic manipulation
  - truth table
- mapping to nand gates+inverters, or nor gates+inverters

| gate | nand  | nor |
|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| AND | NAND->NOT | NOTS->NOR |
| OR | NOTS->NAND | NOR->NOT |
- NOT->NOT cancels


Building blocks
---
- primitive blocks
- predefined blocks
- regular circuits are scalable
  - irregular circuits are non-scalable
- a copy of a reusable building block is an instance of it
  - the procedure is called instantiation


沚 Example
---
implementation the following functions with NAND gates+inverters, then NOR gates+inverters
- $F = AB + \overline{(AB)}C + \overline{(AB})\overline{D} + E$


Rudimentary Logic Functions

|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|:--:|
| 0 | 0 | 1 | 0 | 1 |
| 1 | 0 | 1 | 1 | 0 |


Multiple-bit functions
---
- vectors of single-bit functions
- $F[n:0] = (F_{n-1}, 站ｯ, F_2, F_1, F_0)$
  - $F[n-1:0]$ is a n-bit bus
- $F_i=G_i(A_{m-1},  站ｯ, A_1,A_0)=G_i(A[m-1:0])$
  - $A[m-1:0]$ is a m-bit bus


汳｡  Design Lecture-Hall Lighting Control
---
- controlled by two switches
  - $P$ - podium switch
  - $R$ - rear door switch
- in three modes
  - $M_0$: Either switch P or switch R turns the house lights on and off
  - $M_1$: Only the podium switch P turns the house lights on and off
  - $M_2$: Only the rear switch R turns the house lights on and off
- hint: control modes by enabling


汳｡ Design Car electrical Control using enabling
---
- Inputs
  - Ignition switch IG: Value 0 if off and value 1 if on
  - Light switch LS: Value 0 if off and value 1 if on
  - Radio switch RS: Value 0 if off and value 1 if on
  - Power window switch WS: Value 0 if off and value 1 if on
- Outputs
  - Lights L: Value 0 if off and value 1 if on
  - Radio R: Value 0 if off and value 1 if on
  - Power windows W: Value 0 if off and value 1 if on
  - hint: ignition is the enabling signal for all other switches


Decoding
---
- An n-bit binary code is capable of representing up to $2^n$ distinct elements of coded information
- Decoding is the conversion of an n-bit input code to an m-bit output code with $n 竕､ m 竕､ 2n$, done by a n窶鍍o窶杜-line decoder
  - generates no more than $2^n$ minterms from the n input variables
- 1-to-2 decoder: 
   - $D[1:0]=[A,\overline{A}]$
   - $D_i=m_i$
- 2-to-4 decoder:
  - $D[3:0]=[A_1A_0, A_1\overline{A_0}, \overline{A_1}A_0, \overline{A_1A_0}]$
  - $D_i=m_i$
  - can be constructed in 2 1-to-2 decoder+ 4 AND gates
- 3-to-8 decoder:
  - can be constructed in 1 2-to-4 decoder + 1 1-to-2 decoder + 8 AND gates


沒 Practice
---
- Design the following decoders
  - 4-to-16 decoder
  - 5-to-32 decoder
  - 6-to-64 decoder
